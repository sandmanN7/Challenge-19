# Challenge-19

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a binary classifier that can accurately predict if an applicant will be successful if they are funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Analysis

- The variable IS_SUCSSEFUL is considered the target variable for this model.

- The rest of the columns are considered features for the model.

- The EIN and NAME columns are irrelevant to the model and thus, were removed.

- Was unable to reach the target accuracy of 75%, not even close.

- Adjusted some of the activations, number of layers and units.

## Summary

Initial deep-learning model was more accurate than the optimized versions.
